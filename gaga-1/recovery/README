The backup computer used for recovery.

1. To use this it needs to be uploaded to the GM862 which is achieved
by 'make upload'.

2. A simulated flight can also be run by doing 'make test'.  This is
achieved by the uppercase modules (SER, MDM, MOD, GPS) acting like a
GM862 (including random errors)

3. You must create a file called 'phone.py' with a single function
number() that returns the number you want SMS messages sent to as a
string:

def number():
    return '+447000000000'


TODO

1. Need to contact Telit and ask them what happens to GPS access above
the COCOM limit to make sure gps2 module handles the failure more
correctly.

2. Should delete all files on the Telit module with a clean Makefile
command

3. Performs check the checksum of the loaded scripts in upload
